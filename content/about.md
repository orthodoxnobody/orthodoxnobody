### Who am I?
Who are any of us? Maybe that's a job for anthropology. _Or is it?_

I'm a North American convert to Eastern Orthodoxy from Protestantism (Baptist, Pentecostal, Mennonite Brethren), never really 'switching' denominations with any true intention or dissatisfaction, we mostly just attended church where it made sense or where we felt we fit in. I'm in my 40s. I've been married over 20 years. I have two kids. I live on the West Coast of Canada. I've been a Christian my whole life (in the Protestant tradition you might say 'I asked Jesus into my heart when I was four years old'). The first time I walked into an Orthodox Church was for a Vespers service on March 16, 2015. I never looked back.

### Who is this for?
Interestingly, I've decided to write this blog for myself.

So with that in mind, some might ask "Why bother writing this blog at all when you could just save the world from your ramblings and keep it all on little text files on your computer?". -- to that, the only answer I have is that I hope and pray that someone may find something here that is edifying, or may help them along in their journey.

 If you happen to get something out of any of this writing, Glory to God. I'm not a priest. I'm not even a deacon. If you have concerns about any of these writings, I'd encourage you to talk to your priest (if you're Orthodox), or email me if you are interested in a civil dialogue.

## What are my politics?
I'll save this for a future post.

In the meantime, let me just say I hope to be equally disliked by all people who have glued themselves to any central, port or starboard portion of whatever they believe the political spectrum is. I don't believe that politics, nationalism or patriotism have any place in the Holy Church of God or in the Orthodox Faith, and I believe they are a miserable lens through which a person can view the world. Maybe

> _“I see the key to the Christian perception of culture, of politics, and, of course of religion itself — a ‘holding it all together.’ Christianity is freedom from conservatism and from revolution. Hence a ‘rightist’ Christian is as frightening as a ‘leftist’ one, and I know why I lean towards the left when dealing with the rightists, and to the right when I am with leftists.” -Fr. Alexander Schmemann_ (2)

## Why can't I comment on this blog?

You can comment to me by sending an email to 'me' at the domain that this blog is hosted at. I love talking to people.

## Where can I find you on social media?

That's hilarious. I don't social media.

## Claims and Sources
Of the Orthodox Faith I try very hard not to make _any claim_ about _any thing_ that can not be supported by highly regarded Orthodox teachers (usually Saints, generally and preferably people who are reposed). As one of my favourite priests says:

## Did Something Change?

My goal is to ensure that all writings found here are version controlled. It should not be assumed that the writings are static and unchanging. People change. Our beliefs and our understandings are refined. We grow. We learn. We make mistakes. Sometimes we say things in error or things that are misunderstood. I may rework or modify previous posts, but if I do so, I intend to ensure that previous versions of them will be preserved for reference.
