This piece of writing is likely going to be something half-baked for quite some time. That being said, if the only person I'm really writing any of this for is myself, it shouldn't really matter. 

A few weeks ago (probably a lot of what I say will contain this phrase, and whether it was actually a few weeks ago, or a few years ago, who can tell? Time is fickle...) I arrived at church early one morning to serve behind the altar with my priest. I was wearing a T-shirt with a 1980s G1 Optimus Prime and, chiding me with a big smile and a loving voice, my priest says to me: "You're nothing but a big kid!"

Me: "You're right, Fr. But do you know what Optimus Prime's famous line is?"
Fr: "No idea."
Me: "'Til all are one."
Fr: "That's a pretty good line."

***Unity***. This is something I think about a lot. More stories:

A few years ago, early when we arrived in the community we live in now, I had only begun getting to know our parish priest. I had recently had ACL surgery, and he drove to our home to come for a visit. As we sat on the couch in my office, getting to know each other (best I can remember), we began to argue as we realized how ***different*** we were. We had different views on numerous social and other issues, our dialog became quite heated. 

To be honest, I don't really remember how our visit **ended**. What I **do** remember is how utterly devastated I felt. I had no idea how I was supposed to follow this man or be led by him as my priest. I began to internalize a belief that he was going to hate me (or strongly dislike me at the very least), and I began to panic.

At that point I did what anyone would do, I reached out to two close friends to discuss, and I emailed my previous parish priest in a panic (oh look, alliteration!). I found the email which was borderline incoherent and had all too much preamble. The relevant portion basically being:

> I really need guidance [...]. Half the time I don't know what to do, and half the time I just feel like I'm going to start crying [...]

That afternoon I spoke on the phone with the priest of my previous parish, and he talked me off a ledge. There are a few tidbits from that conversation that I remember specifically, but none of them are overly important to the rest of this story.

During the next many weeks I felt a lot of fear leading up to attending Liturgy. **And yet**, something happened that I did not expect: **my priest *loved* me**. 

Never again did he bring up our disagreements, he never condemned me, never indicated any disagreement with me, nor did he ever treat me with anything other than total and unconditional love and kindness. 

In the years since, we've joked about our different ways of viewing the world, however he has made it **abundantly clear** to me that there is nothing more important than our unity. He has said it over and over again both to me, and to our parish, that there is no room for disunity in the church. In short, I think it can be fair to summarize that **he doesn't care what we disagree on, as long as we agree on Christ**. Do we stand in church and say the **symbol of faith** together? Do we stand here together saying **forgive me brothers and sisters** and come to the chalice together, with gratitude to God and afterwards  "**Behold, this has touched your lips, taken away all your iniquity and cleansed you from all your sins"**

It is years later, and this priest has baptized me, baptized my son, offered me the joy of serving with him behind the altar and loved me unconditionally. He is a **living example** of what **unity of Faith** means.

As is prayed during Small Compline:

> Surround us with your holy angels that, guarded and guided by their host, we may arrive at the _**unity of faith** and the understanding of your ineffable glory_.

It feels very hard to live a **small life** (more on that another time) when the world is so big and so accessible in this day and age. In the past number of days alone we read of schism in the Anglican church, and we see more and more discussions in public discourse about "American Orthodoxy". I am not American (I live in Canada), however I am deeply affected by (and have developed a general disdain for) patriotism and nationalism. The discourse South of our border seems to focus around American Orthodox Christians wanting "their own" Orthodoxy, and is posted on Orthodox web sites with giant images of American Flags. **It fills me with a deep sadness.** 

People regularly call me pedantic, but words are important. There is no such thing as "American" Orthodoxy, nor is their "Greek" Orthodoxy, nor is their "Russian" Orthodoxy. I believe that, properly understood and lived, there is the **one, holy, catholic and apostolic church**, and in some cases the people of that church happen to be in America, some in Greece, some in Russia and some everywhere else. It is not our job to make Orthodoxy ***ours***. It is our job to make ourselves Orthodox. We do not say **how can I make my vision of theosis fit within the framework of my nationalistic ideas**, we say **how can I throw off my nationalism, my politics, the dominating culture of my day, the world -- and put on Christ**. 

And brothers and sisters, these are two **very different things**.
