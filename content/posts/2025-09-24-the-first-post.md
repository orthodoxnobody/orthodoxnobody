## Get out of your head...

Some days it feels like this is all I’m ever trying to do: get out of my head and into the forest; get out of my head and into life with my wife and kids; get out of my head and onto _paper_.

Now, more than ever, I find things rattling around in my head that I need to put somewhere. Sometimes it’s in a journal. Sometimes it’s a random text file on my computer. Sometimes it’s a half-baked essay that ends up in the 'boys chat'. It used to be that I wrote things on the Internet, but for whatever reason those days slowly faded into oblivion and one by one old WordPress installs were relegated to the digital trash heap.

I hope that at worst it's completely forgettable.
{{< /hero-quote >}}

After much prodding, and some internal deliberating, I'm going to try again. I think my motivation is different, and I think I've deliberated enough to ensure that the only person I'm _really_ writing for is myself. That being said, I'd be lying if I didn't say that my hope is that this writing is _helpful_ in _some way_ to _somebody_. To poorly paraphrase my godfather while he was writing one of his early homilies "I hope that at worst it's completely forgettable". That's not an exact quote, but it was what he was trying to convey. 

The ultimate sentiment he was trying to convey was that his primary prayer was to do no harm. This would be my hope and prayer for any writing found here.

## What is this blog about

Primarily, my interests are Orthodox Christianity and theology. You can expect that many or most of the things written here will draw heavily from the Orthodox faith and, subsequently, what that means for how we live our lives. In particular, the writing is targeted to myself (and all the ways I am failing at or struggling to do the aforementioned).

## I want you to write about ...
